![Photo of Cameron Cairns]({static}/images/headshot.jpeg)

Hi I'm Cameron Cairns, I like to write software and live in San Jose, CA.

## Interests
* Getting better at python. I've learned a lot and still feel like there's a lot more to find and learn about in the ecosystem. That being said, I'm interested in getting better at javascript for front end coding, and 

* Hacking away on various projects. I end up spending too much time configuring whichever unix flavor
I'm using at the time, but code eventually ends up on my [github](https://www.github.com/cameroncairns).  Hoping to give a little back to the open source community that has made my life so much better.

* Non profit radio ([I managed a radio station in college](https://www.kdvs.org)). I'm interested in hearing about any cool radio stations (terrestrial or otherwise) that you like.

* Music. I listen to most genres of music ([pig squeals](https://www.wikipedia.org/Screaming_(music)) and pop-country tends to be my limit). Tell me about what new bands you are listening to, or what concerts you've attended recently.

* Traveling. I've mainly visited Central and Eastern Europe but am interested in going to South America, India, and Japan. I would love to hear about any place you visited that surprised you or impacted your life. I'm sorely tempted to try out the digital nomad lifestyle, but have concerns around isolation. So experiences around that would be interesting to hear too.

* Unix enthusiast. Started on Ubuntu in 2005, currently using Debian for desktop and OpenBSD for my servers. Operating Systems tried in no particular order: Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, OpenBSD, QubesOS.
